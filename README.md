# file-compression
 
Huffman encoding is an example of a lossless compression algorithm that works particularly well on text but can, in fact, be applied to any type of file. Using Huffman encoding to compress a file can reduce the storage it requires by a third, half, or even more, in some situations. You’ll be impressed with the compression algorithm, and you’ll be equally impressed that you’re outfitted to implement the core of a tool that imitates one you’re already very familiar with.
